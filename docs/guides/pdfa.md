# PDF/A conformance in pdfnative

PDF/A is the ISO archival profile for PDF (ISO 19005). pdfnative supports
PDF/A-1b, 2b, 2u, and 3b via the `tagged` build option. This guide
explains what works today, what's still in flight, and how to validate
your output against the official reference validator.

## TL;DR

```ts
import { buildPDFBytes } from 'pdfnative';

const pdf = buildPDFBytes(params, { tagged: true });        // PDF/A-2b (default)
const pdf1b = buildPDFBytes(params, { tagged: 'pdfa1b' });  // PDF/A-1b
const pdf2u = buildPDFBytes(params, { tagged: 'pdfa2u' });  // PDF/A-2u
const pdf3b = buildPDFBytes(params, { tagged: 'pdfa3b' });  // PDF/A-3b + attachments
```

Every output written with `tagged` set ships:

- A full structure tree (`/Document → /Table → /TR → /TH|/TD`, `/H1–H3`,
  `/P`, `/L → /LI`, `/Figure`, `/Link`).
- `/ActualText` UTF-16BE on every marked content `/Span`.
- An XMP metadata stream with `pdfaid:part` and `pdfaid:conformance`.
- An sRGB ICC `OutputIntent` (`GTS_PDFA1`).
- `/MarkInfo << /Marked true >>` on the catalog.
- A trailer `/ID` derived deterministically from the document title and
  creation timestamp.
- `/Info CreationDate` byte-equivalent to `xmp:CreateDate`, both with
  timezone offsets.

## v1.0.4 status

The v1.0.4 patch closes the upstream metadata defects flagged by the
official veraPDF reference validator on `medical-800p.pdf` and
`barcode-showcase.pdf`:

| Rule | Status | Fixed in |
|------|--------|----------|
| ISO 19005-1 §6.1.3 — trailer `/ID` always present | ✅ | v1.0.4 |
| veraPDF 6.7.3 t1 — `CreationDate` ↔ `xmp:CreateDate` parity | ✅ | v1.0.4 |
| veraPDF 6.7.3 — `dc:creator` ↔ `/Info /Author` parity | ✅ | v1.0.4 |
| ISO 19005-1 §6.3.4 — `isFontEmbedded` (Latin Helvetica) | ❌ | tracked → v1.0.5 |
| veraPDF 6.2.3.3 — DeviceRGB cascade audit | ❓ | tracked → v1.0.5 |

Until v1.0.5 ships, the `pdfaid:part` claim in XMP must be considered
**aspirational** for any document containing Latin runs — pdfnative
still emits Helvetica as an unembedded standard 14 reference, which
PDF/A forbids. We chose to keep the metadata correct and surface the
gap honestly rather than silently invalidate output.

The full v1.0.5 plan lives in
[release-notes/draft-issue-v1.0.5-latin-embedding.md](https://github.com/Nizoka/pdfnative/blob/main/release-notes/draft-issue-v1.0.5-latin-embedding.md).

## Validating your output

pdfnative ships a thin wrapper around the official veraPDF CLI:

```bash
# 1. Generate the sample suite (writes test-output/)
npm run test:generate

# 2. Run veraPDF against every PDF/A-claiming sample
npm run validate:pdfa
```

The script auto-detects veraPDF on `$PATH` or via the `VERAPDF_HOME`
env var. If veraPDF is not installed it exits 0 with install
instructions — local development never blocks. CI installs veraPDF
deterministically (pinned version) and runs the same script on every
PR — see [.github/workflows/verapdf.yml](https://github.com/Nizoka/pdfnative/blob/main/.github/workflows/verapdf.yml).

veraPDF is invoked as an **external** Java tool. pdfnative remains a
zero-runtime-dependency library; veraPDF is never bundled, linked, or
required by consumers of the npm package.

### Installing veraPDF locally

veraPDF is a Java application. Pick whichever path matches your OS.
After install, either expose `verapdf` on `$PATH` or set the
`VERAPDF_HOME` environment variable to the install directory.

**macOS** — Homebrew cask:

```bash
brew install --cask verapdf
verapdf --version
```

**Linux** — official installer (headless):

```bash
curl -fsSL -o verapdf-installer.zip https://software.verapdf.org/rel/verapdf-installer.zip
unzip verapdf-installer.zip
java -jar verapdf-izpack-installer-*.jar -console
# follow the prompts; defaults are sane
export VERAPDF_HOME="$HOME/verapdf"
export PATH="$VERAPDF_HOME:$PATH"
```

**Windows** — official installer from
<https://docs.verapdf.org/install/>. After install, either add the
install directory to `PATH` or:

```powershell
$env:VERAPDF_HOME = "C:\Program Files\verapdf"
$env:Path += ";$env:VERAPDF_HOME"
verapdf.bat --version
```

**No install at all?** Drop the file into the official online demo
at <https://demo.verapdf.org>. It validates against the same engine,
which is convenient for ad-hoc checks but does not scale to a CI
suite.

### Troubleshooting

**"My PDF fails veraPDF for missing XMP / DeviceRGB / unembedded
font, but I never asked for PDF/A."**

If the file was generated **without** `tagged: true`, it is a plain
ISO 32000-1 document and should not be validated against any PDF/A
profile. The veraPDF online demo lets you pick a profile manually,
which will then surface failures by design — every PDF/A rule about
metadata, output intents, font embedding, transparency, and color
spaces will fire because the file never claimed any of those things.

The `npm run validate:pdfa` wrapper avoids this trap: it scans each
PDF for a `pdfaid:part` declaration in the XMP packet and skips
files that don't claim PDF/A. The summary line reports how many were
skipped:

```
Scanned 146 PDF(s); 7 claim PDF/A, 139 skipped (not PDF/A).
```

If you want a file to be validated, generate it with `tagged: true`
(or any `'pdfa*'` value).

**"My tagged file still fails rule 6.3.4 (font embedding)."**

This is the documented v1.0.4 known limitation — see the table at
the top of this page. Tracking issue:
[draft-issue-v1.0.5-latin-embedding.md](https://github.com/Nizoka/pdfnative/blob/main/release-notes/draft-issue-v1.0.5-latin-embedding.md).

### Output bytes change in v1.0.4

v1.0.4 has no public API break, but PDF outputs differ byte-for-byte
from v1.0.3:

- Trailer `/ID` array is now always present.
- `/Info CreationDate` and `xmp:CreateDate` carry timezone offsets.
- `dc:creator` is emitted only when an author is provided.

If your test fixtures snapshot full PDF bytes, regenerate them.

## PDF/A vs encryption

ISO 19005-1 §6.3.2 forbids combining PDF/A with PDF encryption.
pdfnative validates this at the build boundary — passing both
`tagged: …` and `encryption: …` in the same call throws.

## Choosing a flavour

| Flavour | Base PDF | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| PDF/A-1b (`'pdfa1b'`) | PDF 1.4 | Most conservative — required by some legacy archival systems. No transparency, no JPEG2000, no AES. |
| PDF/A-2b (`true` / `'pdfa2b'`) | PDF 1.7 | Default. Allows transparency, layers, embedded TrueType. |
| PDF/A-2u (`'pdfa2u'`) | PDF 1.7 | 2b + Unicode mapping for every glyph. Required when `/ActualText` and ToUnicode CMap completeness matter (recommended for accessibility). |
| PDF/A-3b (`'pdfa3b'`) | PDF 1.7 | 2b + arbitrary `/EmbeddedFile` attachments (XML, source data, etc.). |

All four flavours share the same XMP / OutputIntent / structure-tree
infrastructure — pdfnative only varies the PDF version, the
`pdfaid:part`, and the `pdfaid:conformance` value.

## Hard invariants for contributors

These rules are documented in the contributor instruction file
[.github/instructions/pdfa-conformance.instructions.md](https://github.com/Nizoka/pdfnative/blob/main/.github/instructions/pdfa-conformance.instructions.md):

- `/Info CreationDate` and `xmp:CreateDate` come from the **same**
  `buildPdfMetadata()` call. Never inline `new Date()` in the builders.
- The unencrypted trailer `/ID` is derived deterministically from
  `MD5(title + creationDate + objectCount)`. Never randomize — it
  breaks `buildPDFBytes(params)` byte-equality tests.
- `dc:creator` is emitted only when an author is provided and is
  XML-escaped.
- XMP metadata streams are never compressed.
- Compression always happens **before** encryption (ISO 32000-1
  §7.3.8).
